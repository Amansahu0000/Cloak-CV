# Cloak-CV
Designed and developed a real-time computer vision system using Python and OpenCV that creates an "invisibility cloak" effect. The system replaces a specific colored object with a static background, demonstrating my ability to integrate hardware and software for seamless, real-time video processing and performance optimization.
